# SnapList Enhancements

## Planned

(nothing currently)

## Completed

### Compact view
Single-line note entries with toggle button. Shows icon, title, category badge, first hashtag, and timestamp. Click row to edit. Tighter spacing (space-y-1) in compact mode.

### Fix category tabs overflow
Desktop: tabs wrap to 2 rows so nothing gets cut off. Mobile: horizontal scroll preserved (single row) to avoid too many rows on narrow screens.

### UI design refresh
- Source Serif 4 serif font for titles/brand
- Amber accent color replacing violet/purple (better dark mode contrast)
- Consistent SVG line icons replacing emoji category icons
- Color-coded left accent bars on NoteCards per category
- Per-category colored badges
- Teal hashtag color for differentiation
- Improved dark mode text contrast
- Tighter card spacing for info density
